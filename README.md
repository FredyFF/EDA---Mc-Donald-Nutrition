## EDA McDonald-Nutrition
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) about Mc Donald Nutrition Menu

I have explored the McDonald's dataset to find the answers for the following questions:
1. In each dish, what menu is suitable for customers who are on a diet ?
2. What foods contain the most calories ?
3. What is the total nutritional value if a customer orders the menu (Hamburger, Chicken McNuggets (6 pieces), Premium Southwest Salad with Crispy Chicken, and Strawberry Sundae) ?
4. Explain in simple terms each menu category being sold so that customers can easily understand ?
5. What menus should be avoided / not recommended for diabetes sufferers ?
